There are actually two kinds of time-varying values, which is easy to see if we consider a few different kinds of stimuli from the world:</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><ul class="c24"><li class="c25 pcalibre"><span class="c4">Current mouse position</span></li><li class="c25 pcalibre"><span class="c4">Sequence of keystrokes</span></li><li class="c25 pcalibre"><span class="c4">Current user location</span></li><li class="c25 pcalibre"><span class="c4">Sequence of network responses</span></li><li class="c25 pcalibre"><span class="c4">Current status of mode keys</span></li><li class="c25 pcalibre"><span class="c4">Sequence of mouse-clicks</span></li><li class="c25 pcalibre"><span class="c4">Current time</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">Notice that several of those are “current…” and others are “sequence of…”. The former have the property that they always have a value, and the value may change at any time. The latter have the property that at any given moment they may not have a value—for instance, there may not be a “current keystroke”—and we don’t know when (or if) the next one will come, and there may be an infinite number of them. The latter are, of course, just </span><span class="c7">streams</span><span class="calibre3">, often called </span><span class="c7">event streams</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">If we go back to our original counter example, we had both present. The elapsed time was a behavior (always has a value, which changes either when a second finishes or when a button is clicked). The sequence of button presses is, conversely, an event stream: at any given moment there may not be a press, we don’t know when or even if the next one will come, and there may be an unbounded number of them (from a very bored user).
