When we impose a type system on JavaScript, we expect, say, the type </span><span class="c28">(Number -&gt; String)</span><span class="calibre3"> to be different from the type </span><span class="c28">(String -&gt; Boolean)</span><span class="calibre3">. Similarly, an object that contains only the fields </span><span class="c28">x</span><span class="calibre3"> and </span><span class="c28">y</span><span class="calibre3"> is very different from the object that contains only the method </span><span class="c28">draw</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">However, these nuances are lost on </span><span class="c28">typeof</span><span class="calibre3">, which is innocent to even the existence of any such type systems. Therefore, all those functions are lumped under one tag, </span><span class="c28">"function"</span><span class="calibre3">, and all those objects are similarly treated uniformly as one tag, </span><span class="c28">"object"</span><span class="calibre3"> (and analogously in Python). This is because their names are misleading: what they are reporting are not the </span><span class="c7">types</span><span class="calibre3"> but rather the run-time </span><span class="c7">tags</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">The difference between types and tags can grow arbitrarily big. After all, the number of types in a program can grow without bound, and so can their size (e.g., you can have a list of lists of arrays of functions from …). But the set of tags is fixed in many languages, though in those that allow you to define new (data)classes, this set might grow. Nevertheless, tags are meant to take up a fixed amount of space and be checked in a small constant amount of time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">Of course, this difference is not inherently problematic. After all, even in statically-typed languages with algebraic datatypes, we still need space to track variants, which requires a kind of (intra-type) tag. The issue is rather with the choice of </span><span class="c7">name</span><span class="calibre3">: that </span><span class="c28">typeof</span><span class="calibre3"> and </span><span class="c28">type</span><span class="calibre3"> do not, actually, return “types”. A more accurate name for them would be something like </span><span class="c28">tagof</span><span class="c4">, leaving the term “type” free for actual static type systems.</span></p></body></html>
