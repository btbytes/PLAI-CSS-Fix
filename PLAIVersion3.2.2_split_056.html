Its rarity means ideas we learn using macros will take some effort to port to other languages; but its power means we can write quite sophisticated systems by leveraging the full power of Racket, and we will do so. In essence, Racket macros compile an extended version of Racket—call it Racket++, if you like—down to Racket, where we can then exploit the full power of the existing Racket framework.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">We will introduce the Racket macro system through a series of examples.
