However, we don’t obtain the space benefits of the algebraic datatype definition. We created two distinct types; in principle, that’s not a problem. However, to write programs, we needed to have predicates (</span><span class="c28">mt?</span><span class="calibre3"> and </span><span class="c28">node?</span><span class="calibre3">) that took </span><span class="c7">any</span><span class="calibre3"> value. Therefore, those predicates need type-tags on the values to be able to tell what kind of value they are looking at. Observe that these are </span><span class="c7">type</span><span class="calibre3"> tags, not </span><span class="c7">variant</span><span class="c4"> tags, so the amount of space they need is proportional to the number of types in the whole program, not just the number of variants in that particular algebraic datatype definition.</span></p></body></html>
