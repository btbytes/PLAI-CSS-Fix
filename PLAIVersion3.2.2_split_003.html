That is, I conjecture that roughly 10% of students in a programming languages class are like the educator: they are deeply excited about and motivated to learn the subject, identify with it personally, and may want to continue to study it further. These are wonderful students, and many of them will go on to become the next generation of educators. There are several terrific books that are designed—or at least, work best—for this kind of student.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">But most of them—say 90%—may not have this deep personal identification. Instead, they want to learn the subject enough to become better computer scientists. What do </span><span class="c7">they</span><span class="c4"> need to learn, and how do they need to learn it? They are the target audience for this book. On the one hand, the book tries to connect to many programming tasks. At the same time, it’s too easy to pander to such an audience. The book tries to balance these connections with a focus on principles that will stand the learner in good stead for a long time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">Of course, I believe the 10% will learn something useful from this book, too. If nothing else, they may learn a different </span><span class="c7">perspective</span><span class="c4"> on the subject, and maybe also develop some empathy for learners not like themselves. If nothing else, well over a dozen students who used earlier editions of this book successfully completed PhDs in programming languages, and several are themselves professors now. So, at least, the book has not harmed them. I can live with those odds.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">I have also written this book with working programmers in mind. Many of them may have not had a formal computer science education, or at least one that included a proper introduction to programming languages. At some point, like that 90% of students, some of them become curious about the media they use. I want this book to speak to them, gently drawing them away from the hustle and bustle of daily programming into a space of reflection and thought.</span></p></body></html>
