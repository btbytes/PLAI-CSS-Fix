This means types cannot refer to dynamic conditions, and may suffer from either false-positive or false-negative errors (e.g., something that is in the code but can never run in practice may still cause a type error); in return, they give us guarantees without ever having to run the program. This is important when the program is expensive to run, impossible (e.g., it depends on conditions that can’t be reproduced by the developer), or dangerous.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">Types aren’t really a part of SMoL either, but not because we can add them through desugaring (which we can’t); rather, it’s for the first two reasons: many languages don’t have them, and those that do don’t often agree on their form (in large part because of their disagreement over the nature of objects). However, there are parts they </span><span class="c7">do</span><span class="c4"> (largely) agree on, which we will begin with.</span></p></body></html>
