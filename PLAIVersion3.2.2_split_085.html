Object construction then makes instances of each as it goes up the inheritance chain. There is another way to think of the parent: not as a class to be instantiated but, instead, directly as an object itself. Then all children with the same parent would observe the very same object, which means changes to it from one child object would be visible to another child. The shared parent object is known as a </span><span class="c7">prototype</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c40">Aside:</span><span class="calibre3"> The archetypal prototype-based language is </span><span class="c16"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://selflanguage.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1695232021325680&amp;usg=AOvVaw34T7y09URpNkHh7uTLFlXk">Self</a></span><span class="c4">. Though you may have read that languages like JavaScript are “based on” Self, there is value to studying the idea from its source, especially because Self presents these ideas in their purest form.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Some language designers have argued that prototypes are more primitive than classes in that, with other basic mechanisms such as functions, one can recover classes from prototypes—but not the other way around. That is essentially what we have done above: each “class” function contains inside it an object description, so a class is an object-returning-function. Had we exposed these as two different operations and chosen to inherit directly an object, we would have something akin to prototypes.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c40">Exercise:</span><span class="c4"> Modify the inheritance pattern above to implement a Self-like, prototype-based language, instead of a class-based language. Because classes provide each object with distinct copies of their parent objects, a prototype-language might provide a “clone” operation to simplify creation of the operation that simulates classes atop prototypes.</span></p></body></html>
