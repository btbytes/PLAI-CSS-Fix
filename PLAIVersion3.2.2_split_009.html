I remain deeply grateful to all the people who helped make those editions happen.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">My group’s PhD students, especially Jack Wrenn, have tolerated years of my complaining about my course. Amidst their eye-rolling they heard me out, batted away my worst ideas, and fleshed out my better ones. I am deeply fortunate to be able to work with them.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">John Clements’s sabbatical at Brown was a huge fillip to my rethinking the basics, and our conversations reminded me how much I have missed his company.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Kuang-Chen Lu has believed in this project from the start, and built and maintained numerous of the materials that make it possible. He has not only collaborated on but actively leads many of the materials that power or augment this book. His dissertation research will likely lead to significant improvements in how we teach programming languages.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">Matthew Flatt’s fingerprints are all over this book. I especially thank him for the Racket ecosystem and the </span><span class="c28">#lang</span><span class="c4"> concept, which also drove the redesign of this book, and for the plait language especially, which is central to much of this book’s code.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Most of this book’s ideas and composition were formed on the East Bay Bike Path. To the people who made it happen and keep it alive, many thanks, and may the winds always be at your back (which they often can be, if you ride south and then back north between 2pm and 4pm).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">Finally, this book wouldn’t have migrated from head to page without the love and support of Kathi and Tara, who </span><span class="c7">also</span><span class="calibre3"> tolerated years of my complaining about my course and provided their </span><span class="c7">own</span><span class="calibre3"> eye-rolling support. They are my rocks.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3"> </span></p></body></html>
