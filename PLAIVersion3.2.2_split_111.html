In terms of running </span><span class="c40">time</span><span class="calibre3">, we are now clearly paying for the overhead of safety checks. In terms of </span><span class="c40">space</span><span class="calibre3">, we are paying for the tags. Thus, we have had to get worse space </span><span class="c7">and</span><span class="c4"> time.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Nevertheless, the price of unsafe languages is so high—e.g., in the form of security problems—and the cost of safety is often so low, that programmers gladly pay this price (or do so without even particularly noticing it).</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">Still, it would be nice if we didn’t have to pay the price at all. And there is a way to accomplish that: </span><span class="c7">types</span><span class="c4">.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">Look at our “bad” programs. These are programs that can </span><span class="c7">statically</span><span class="calibre3"> be rejected by a type-checker. If we could reject all such programs, then—since no “bad” programs would be left—we can then run the program on the </span><span class="c7">unsafe</span><span class="c4"> evaluator without worrying about negative consequences. This, in effect, is what most typed languages, like Java and OCaml, do. Thus we find another use for types: to improve program performance. But this requires care.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c40">Exercise:</span><span class="calibre3"> Usually, in computer science, we talk about a space-time </span><span class="c7">tradeoff</span><span class="calibre3">. Yet here we seem to have a situation where we’ve improved (i.e., reduced the use of) both the space </span><span class="c7">and</span><span class="c4"> the time! How is that possible?</span></p></body></html>
