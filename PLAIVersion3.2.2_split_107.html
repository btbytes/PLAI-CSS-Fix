Typical examples of partiality may include </span><span class="c28">+</span><span class="calibre3"> applying only to certain types of values. However, I intentionally write “operations” rather than, say, “functions”, because these could be primitive operations like application (expecting the first position to be a function or method) as well. In fact, in some languages like JavaScript, there are very few violations, as the </span><span class="c16"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1695232021400146&amp;usg=AOvVaw1NOpkYKNjpy6IwTp-vrqEQ">Wat talk</a></span><span class="c4"> shows.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">How must these be enforced? It can be either statically or dynamically. In Python and JavaScript, for instance, all safety violations are reported dynamically. In Java or OCaml, most of them are reported statically. Either way, safety means that </span><span class="c7">data have integrity</span><span class="calibre3">: there is some notion of “what they are”, and that identity is respected by operations.
