However, that is too simplistic. Racket’s power comes from its ability to define new languages: </span><span class="c16"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/fffkbmt-programmable-prog-lang/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1695232021067394&amp;usg=AOvVaw214fGxlshmCAnJzUJUG5dk">this article</a></span><span class="calibre3"> and </span><span class="c16"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/R_1TnfCuxK8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1695232021067621&amp;usg=AOvVaw055kiEdpnPdwxtKaQRyL0R">this brief video</a></span><span class="calibre3"> discuss that in more detail. Indeed, some programs in this book are written in the Racket programming language (</span><span class="c28">#lang racket</span><span class="calibre3">), but many are in a language ideally designed for this book (</span><span class="c28">#lang plait</span><span class="c4">). In addition, other parts define their own languages: there are multiple SMoL languages and well over a dozen mystery languages. Thus, while the learner must demonstrate some forbearance for parenthetical syntax, in return they will be richly rewarded with learning experiences.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">The existence of </span><span class="c28">#lang</span><span class="calibre3">, in some ways, drove this book’s redesign. I had some hand in that feature’s </span><span class="c16"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/cffk-macros-to-dsls/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1695232021068197&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ek0jEgcbTPyCNMaXY6ktq">design</a></span><span class="calibre3">, which made me acutely self-conscious: materials intended to be for a broad audience shouldn’t be about work too close to my heart. That was one of the reasons that, while the first edition used a predecessor of Racket, the second edition did not. In the process, however, I realized that I was depriving my students of numerous learning opportunities: after all, what better medium for the study of languages than a language designed for designing languages? For instance, the first version of the mystery languages were ad hoc and confusing; reimplementing them as a collection of Racket </span><span class="c28">#lang</span><span class="c4">s made them far simpler and clearer (and also open them up to be an object of direct study themselves). Thus, this edition doubles down (and then some) on the use of Racket. Getting it right can be tricky (e.g., avoiding mode confusion) and may take a few iterations, but it’s well worth the effort.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p></body></html>
