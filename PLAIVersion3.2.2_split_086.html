It’s easy to generalize this to there being many, which leads naturally to </span><span class="c7">multiple inheritance</span><span class="c4">. In effect, we have multiple objects to which we can chain the lookup, which of course raises the question of what order in which we should do so.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">It would be bad enough if the ascendants were arranged in a tree, because even a tree does not have a canonical order of traversal: take just breadth-first and depth-first traversal, for instance (each of which has compelling uses). Worse, suppose a blob A extends B and C; but now suppose B and C each extend D. Now we have to confront this question: will there be one or two D objects in the instance of A? Having only one saves space and might interact better with our expectations, but then, will we visit this object once or twice? Visiting it twice should not make any difference, so it seems unnecessary. But visiting it once means the behavior of one of B or C might change. And so on. As a result, virtually every multiple-inheritance language is accompanied by a subtle algorithm merely to define the lookup order.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">This infamous situation is called the </span><span class="c16"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1695232021327121&amp;usg=AOvVaw33E5ifiPPmd1ChrRegan9z">“diamond problem”</a></span><span class="c4"> (or even, “the Deadly Diamond of Death”!). If you choose to include multiple inheritance in your language you can lose yourself for days in design decisions on this. Because it is highly unlikely you will find a canonical answer, your pain will have only begun. Multiple inheritance is only attractive until you’ve thought it through.</span></p></body></html>
