As we’ll soon see, the analogy will break down a bit.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="calibre3">Another perspective is to think of types as a </span><span class="c7">static discipline</span><span class="calibre3">: a way of statically making judgments about programs. In a way, we have already been doing just this: it’s called </span><span class="c7">parsing</span><span class="c4">. A parser statically (i.e., before the program runs) passes judgment (i.e., decides that some programs are good and others are bad). Types can be viewed as an extension of this idea.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c40">Aside:</span><span class="calibre3"> In computability theory terms, parsers are usually </span><span class="c7">context-free</span><span class="calibre3">, whereas types usually reflect </span><span class="c7">context-sensitive</span><span class="calibre3"> constraints. Computability theory then helps us understand why we might separate these checks into two separate phases, and in particular why we might do one before the other. Essentially, the type-checker only needs to deal with programs that have already passed the parsing, i.e., context-free check, so it has much less complexity than if it had to do everything. We already saw this: our previous checker only consumed </span><span class="c28">Expr</span><span class="c4">s, which are produced by the parser.</span></p></body></html>
